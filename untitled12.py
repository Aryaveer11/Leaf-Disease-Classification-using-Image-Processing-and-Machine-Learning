"""Now that we have a trained model, we can use it to predict whether a new image is of a healthy or diseased leaf.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

* Analysis of RGB histograms revealed distinct differences between healthy and diseased leaves, particularly in the red and green channels, indicating that color features are important for classification.
* Local Binary Patterns (LBP) texture features were successfully extracted from 206 images (103 healthy and 103 diseased), resulting in a feature array of shape (206, 25).
* A RandomForestClassifier was trained on the extracted LBP features, achieving an AUC score of 0.9756 on the test set, indicating high discriminative power.
* The model misclassified only 1 image in the test set.

### Insights or Next Steps

* The high AUC score suggests that LBP features, combined with a RandomForestClassifier, are effective in distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves in this dataset.
* Further investigation into the single misclassified image, perhaps examining its visual characteristics or the LBP features extracted from it, could provide insights for potential model or feature engineering improvements.
